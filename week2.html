                This week, we looked at the assignment 1 brief as well as the history of web design from 1990 to 1998. We also learned about user personas and why they are valuable.

                Significant changes have been made throughout the history of the internet to get us to where we are today. Notably, the birth of the world-wide web and the development of HTML are what allowed for the creation of websites. Another important development was the start of UX. This helped focus on creating the intuitive and user-friendly websites that we have today. We also saw the emergence of large companies such as Google and Apple within these years. It was really eye-opening to see how these large companies began very differently and how their designs have become staples in our modern society.

                In the context of web design, personas are semi-fictional characters based on current or ideal customers. User personas are important as they help designers better understand the needs and preferences of their target audience. This ensures that our final design lines up with the user's needs. While they are good for designing, sometimes they aren't the most optimal as they generalize our target audience, which can make our design limited. I think that user personas may not be the best on their own, but when they are paired with other design processes such as testing and research, they can help us create a more effective design.

                For the workshop, we got into groups and created a persona that we presented to the class. In my group, we created Granny Linda, who was an elderly person who had arthritis. By working together as a group, we were able to brainstorm and discuss her characteristics, needs, and pain points. Creating this persona really helped me humanize and try to understand different perspectives. This can help inform my design decisions that could make for a more user-friendly and accessible website for people with similar conditions.

                This lecture talks about the fundamental basics of HTML. It teaches us how to properly set up our code as well as headings, tags, paragraphs, and images. This was a good and simple introduction to HTML for me, and it made me realize that it is not as scary as it seems.Â
