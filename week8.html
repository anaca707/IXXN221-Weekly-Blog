             <p>
                This week, we handed in assignment 2.1 (WOOHOO!) and looked into what we needed to do for assignment 2.2.

                Overall, I am happy with how my prototype came out, and I ended up learning many techniques that I will apply to my future projects. A specific technique that I found to be really helpful for my final prototype was the use of grids. I really liked using them because it helped ensure that all my elements were properly spaced between each other and consistent throughout. If I had more time, I think it would be fun to develop the other pages of my website and make them more interactive.

                For assignment 2.2, we are tasked with creating our website through a CMS, or HTML and CSS. Because I am new to both CMS and coding with HTML and CSS, I am a little nervous about how it will turn out. Despite this, I'm also excited to see what I can learn from it.

                For the class activity, we had to present our project to the class. Seeing everyone's final prototype was really fun and inspiring. Although I'm not the most confident speaker, everyone was really nice, and sharing my project with the class was really helpful in building up my confidence. It was also very helpful to get immediate feedback on things like keeping colors consistent and managing the sizing of elements. I will definitely keep an eye out for these in assignment 2.2.

                This lecture was Part 2 of last week and talked about making our website responsive through grid layouts and media queries. These help the design of the website be responsive according to the user's screen size. A key takeaway from this lecture was that I should start off with the phone layout first, as it will save coding time and move down to desktop.
