                This week, I handed in the first assignment for this course(woo!). We also learned about color and typography in terms of web design.

                Overall, I think that my research report lays a good foundation for the upcoming assignments, and it has given me a solid idea of what I want my website to look like. If I had time, I think that it would be good to create other user personas that are more different from my demographic, such as an elderly person or a child. By doing so, it could help provide insights and perspectives that I may not have considered and lead to a more diverse and inclusive design.

                Both color and typography help give our website an identity with a certain vibe or aesthetic. By having good colors and type, it can make our website easier to navigate and engage with. Having good color contrast can also make our website more accessible because elements will be easier to differentiate. This can be checked through sources such as WebAIM and WhoCanUse. Typography is also important, as having good spacing and hierarchy between texts makes readability easier for users.

                For the second assignment, we are required to create a high-fidelity prototype of our website. I think that it would be a good idea to use the ideas from this lecture to ensure a more appealing prototype.  
            </P>

                For the workshop, we looked at the design of a candle website critiqued it on Figjam. I did this workshop with some classmates in person becausehad a class together. It was really interesting to see how they were able to point out mistakes that I couldn't identify initially such as scaling and font weight. This made me realize how having a second opinion/perspective can be. While I could identify other elements in the website, they were able to find things that I couldn’t spot which allowed for an overall more precise and thoughrough critique.  
            </P>

            <P><br/>
                By the end of the break, I hope to have finished my low-fidelity prototypes at least so that I can get some feedback on the first week back that will help with my high-fidelity prototype.  
            </P>
