             <p>
                For the lecture this week, we looked into responsive design and file organization, as well as some project support at the end.

            <h4> <br/>
                Responsive design and organization
            </h4>

            <p>
                Responsive design creates designs that work seamlessly across a range of devices. This can range from desktop computers all the way to tablets and smartphones. When creating our website, we should also consider the many different ways that a user could interact with the website. By doing so, we can allow for easy navigation and an overall better experience. Typography can also be used to achieve responsive design. Using relative units like REM and rem is useful for creating consistent font sizes when scaling devices.

                Organization can help us stay productive and make our project easier to work on. This can be done through things such as properly naming files, structuring folders, managing assets, and documenting. I definitely overlook organization when it comes to my projects, and I often get stressed out when I cannot locate certain files or images. It has made me realize how big of a deal it actually can be. Alt text is also really important in web design as it helps describe an image, which makes it more accessible for impaired users, search images, or when an image may be broken. For this assignment, I will try to keep everything as organized as possible so that I can avoid the stress and problems that come from unorganization.

                Assignment 2.2 update

            <!--Body 3-->
            <P>
                In terms of assignment 2.2, we should aim to have our website be able to resize to tablets at least.  Initially, I wanted to try and code my website for assignment 2.2, but I realized that it might be a bit too complicated when I don't fully understand it yet. For this reason, I decided to use CMS so that I could familiarize myself with how elements work and how to properly lay out my website. This will be my first time using CMS, so it will be a new learning experience for me. I looked at YouTube videos on how to use and navigate CMS, such as Editor X. This helped me feel less anxious about the assignment and gave me a better idea of where things were located and how I could implement my Figma design on the web.
