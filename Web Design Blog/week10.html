            <p>
                For this week's lecture, we looked at the submission requirements needed for assignment 2.2 as well as some blog exemplars of assignment 3.

                My key takeaway from the blog exemplars was to keep everything simple. This is especially important for me, as I am a beginner in CSS and HTML, and it will help me understand the fundamentals before I move on to more complex projects. Despite this, the example blogs were both really creative and gave me a really good idea of what I needed to do for the final assignment.

            <P>
                Currently, I have trouble figuring out how to make carousels that are similar to the ones in my Figma prototype. However, after looking at some YouTube tutorials, I learned how to code an automatic carousel into Editor X and adjust it accordingly to my design. I also ended up changing the community discussion page according to my feedback from assignment 2.1. The feedback highlighted that my use of black and white colors was similar to my beige and dark blue, so they suggested replacing all of my black and whites with them instead. I think that I will play around with the color combinations to see what looks the most cohesive and appealing.

            During project support, I asked about resources that could help me with coding, and the tutors recommended Flexbox Froggy and Gridgarden to help me understand how to position elements within my code. These resources were very cute, and they definitely helped me visualize and understand howthey worked.
