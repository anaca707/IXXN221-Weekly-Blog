                This week, we talked about the history of web design from 2009 to the present day, as well as customer journey maps and user flows.

                Many things occurred throughout the history of web design to get us to where we are today. In 2009, Facebook-like buttons were implemented. It is crazy to see how this function has impacted the internet and has become a staple of web design. I personally think that the like feature is really cool because not only does it help us engage with other users, it also helps creators understand how well a post is received at a glance. As technology continues to advance, we were introduced to platforms such as figma and adob XD. These have made web design more accessible and easier than ever. With the uprising of AI, I think it will be interesting to see the future of web design.

                We also looked into customer journey maps and why they are used. A customer journey map displays the key steps a user may take throughout their interaction with a product or service. Throughout each step, they will do an activity that may change their emotions positively or negatively. This is helpful because it allows designers to identify specific pain points that users may encounter to create targeted improvements that enhance the overall user experience.

                User flows also show the user's complete path when using a product or service. This helps us visualize and get an idea of how we could lay out our website. When creating a user flow, we should have consistent colors, shapes, and anatomy, along with meaningful labels.

            <P>
                This lecture covers CSS box models and style sheets. A CSS page or style sheet allows us to access and alter our HTML elements. The box model helps us control the layout of HTML elements. This consists of content, padding, borders, and margins. From my understanding, margins are the space outside of an element, borders are the lines that surround the content, and padding is the space between the border and content. I still find this a little confusing, but I think that once I use it in my design, it'll be easier to understand.
