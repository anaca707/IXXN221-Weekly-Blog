                This week is the final week for lectures and we recapped the requirements for the submission for assignment 3 as well as the contents that we discussed in every week.

                For our final activity we got into groups and redesigned the website that we previously critiqued. Although we ran into some issues with the Figma at first we ended up all contributing to the redesign by the end of the session. I really enjoyed working in a group as we were all able to chip in our own ideas and give each other feedback while we redesigned. We were able to discuss between each other to determine the best method of approach within each section. I had a lot of fun experimenting and playing around with redesigning the website to see how it would look if we were to change it according to our critiques.

                Overall this course was a good challenge for me and I was able to learn many new things ranging from coding (CSS + HTML), Figma, user personas all the way to CMS platforms. I think that all the content that I've learned was really intuitive and although I did get stressed at times, it has taught me how to manage my learning and time better. All the skills that I learned in this course will  be applied into future projects and I hope to continue to get better.
