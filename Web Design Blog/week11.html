                This week, we all presented our website to the class. Everyone had really cool websites, and it was really interesting to see how they converted their Figma prototypes into websites. It was really inspiring to see what could be achieved through web design.

                Assignment 2.2 Reflection
            </h4>
            <p>
                Overall, I am quite happy with how my website turned out, considering that it was my first time using Editor X. If I had more time or were to do this again, I would want to make elements such as the quiz interactive so that users could actually find their recommended tea. I also want to look into animation transitions for my carousels so that they can transition more smoothly between images. From my feedback, I realize that I should try to be more thorough with consistency when creating my website so that everything is cohesive and less confusing.

                Coding lecture reflection
            </h4>
            <P>
                As we move into the final assignment, I have found the coding lectures to be really helpful in helping me understand the fundamentals of using HTML and CSS. However, because content is limited, I think that I will need to do my own research and experiment around for my final blog. Although I now know what all elements taught us to do, I tend to overthink and confuse myself about when to use certain elements (like grids, containers, sections, margins vs. padding). However, I think that over time and with practice, this will become easier for me.
