                For this week's lecture, we looked into the history of web design from 1998–2008 as well as design goals and the importance of web design.

                Looking through the history of web design made me realize how different the internet used to be.  The introduction of WCAG 2.0 in 2008 was a turning point in web design by setting standards and ensuring accessibility for all users.  It states that content and web control Features must be perceptible, operable,understandable and robust enough to work with today’s and future technologies.This was a crucial turning point because it ensured that websites were designed and developed with inclusivity in mind which made the internet more accessible to a wider range of users. The million-dollar homepage from 2005 was also especially eye-catching to me because of the creative idea behind it and how chaotic everything is, along with all the neon colors.

            <P>
                Good web design is needed because if the website is poorly designed, users are less likely to engage. In order to do this, goals help drive our design decisions. When it comes to web design, it can have both qualitative and quantitative goals. Qualitative goals focus on subjective aspects such as aesthetics and user experience. On the other hand, quantitative goals delve into analytics and measurable data. By having a middle ground of both qualitative and quantitative goals, designers can create websites that not only look great but also optimally achieve their intended objectives.

            <P>
                TFor the workshop, we created a Venn diagram based on a user persona from last week. My group did a Venn diagram for Bella.  Venn diagrams are valuable tools in the website creation process, as they help us bridge the gap between designers and users. This activity allowed us to identify the shared goals between the designer and the user. By understanding these shared goals, we can align our design choices with the needs and preferences of the user and stakeholders. It helps create an opportunity for a more inclusive design and promotes the overall experience for everyone.

            <P>
                This lecture taught us more HTML basics such as anchor tags, breaks, and lists. Anchor tags help create hyperlinks, which allow us to navigate to different pages. Breaks help us create space between texts or images. Finally, lists help us group and organize a set of items. This lecture also recommended using a live server, which I found really helpful and time-saving for accessing my website.
