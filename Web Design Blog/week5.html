                This week was relatively short and simple, but we got a rundown of how we needed to hand in our first assignment.

                For my project, I decided to center my idea around tea. For this reason, I needed to create a user persona who may be interested in the topic. I chose the idea of tea specifically because I often drink tea when I am studying, and through my research and experience, I have found tea to be beneficial in various ways.  I used a university graduate for my persona, as I find it easier to empathize with and accurately understand individuals within this demographic. Being a student myself, I am immersed in an environment with numerous peers who are either current students or recent graduates. This provides a solid foundation for constructing my user persona. Before I hand in my assignment, I want to gather more research and references so that my ideas are more backed up and grounded.

                This lecture covered part 1 of CSS grids, which talks about divs and flexboxes. Grids consist of a grid container and grid items that can be arranged in rows and columns. Divs help us manage where things go on our website and group elements together. There are 2 main types of divs, an ID and a class. IDs you don’t repeat in your code whereas classes do.  Flexboxes on the other hand help us lay out and distribute items within containers. This is helpful because it allows us to ensure that content can be viewed nicely even when the screen size is different.

                These concepts and coding are still a bit confusing to me, but they will definitely be useful once I start coding for my assignment and use them to lay out my elements.
