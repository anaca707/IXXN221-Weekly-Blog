                This week we got an introduction to the course and the teaching staff! 

            <!--Heading-->

                For this course, we have three assignments along with weekly quizzes to help us understand how to code. The first assignment will be a research report on personas. The second assignment is split into two parts. The first part is about developing a prototype, while the second part is about implementing it into an actual website. Finally, the final assignment is these journal entries! Although my knowledge of figma is quite limited, I'm excited to get back into things. I am also a complete beginner in HTML and CSS, so I am also looking forward to learning about how to design websites with the help of code.

                During the lecture, we did an icebreaker activity to introduce ourselves. For this, we created a name tag on a Figjam where we talked about our studies, hobbies, and a place that we would like to visit one day. It was really fun to see how everyone decorated their name tags to make them more personalized.

                There wasn't too much that needed to be done as it was the first week, but I look forward to the next lecture, where we go more in depth about assignment 1!
