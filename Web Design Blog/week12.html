                This week is the final week for lectures, and we recapped the requirements needed for the submission of assignment 3. Along with this, we recapped all the content that we'd learned throughout the weeks.

            <p>
                For our final activity, we got into groups and redesigned the candle website that we previously critiqued. We ran into some issues with getting everyone in the group to see the Figma file at first, but we ended up all contributing to the redesign by the end of the session. I really enjoyed working in a group, as we were all able to chip in our own ideas and give each other feedback while we redesigned together. We were able to discuss with each other to determine the best method of approach within each section. I had a lot of fun experimenting and playing around with redesigning the website to see how it would look if we were to change it according to our critiques.

                Overall, this course was a good challenge for me.  I learned a variety of new techniques and tools that have expanded my skillset. For example, I learned how to use UX techniques (user personas, venn diagrams) to improve the user experience of a website. I also gained more proficiency in Figma and learned about CMS, which helped me create a (somewhat) functional website. Lastly, I delved into coding CSS and HTML for the first time. Coding was by far the most difficult aspect for me because I had to approach designing from a more technical perspective.  I had to watch ALOT (maybe too many) videos along with the lecture recordings to wrap my head around the meaning of different terms and when to use which. Despite this,  moments when my code finally works are definitely satisfying. This course has definitely piqued my interest in coding, and I would like to continue developing my skills so that I can incorporate them into my future designs.
