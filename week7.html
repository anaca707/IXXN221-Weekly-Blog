                For this week's lecture, we learned about composition and affordances. We also looked into the submission requirements for assignment 2.1, along with some project support.

                Grids help us align and display elements nicely, which is easier for our eyes to navigate through. Other aspects, such as hierarchy, color, typography, scale, and white space, can also be used to create a good composition.  In my previous projects, I found myself struggling with keeping elements aligned and consistent. I think that using grids will definitely help improve the overall layouts of my future projects.

                Affordances are cues that give a hint as to how users may interact with something. This can be based on mental models formed from past interactions with websites and other experiences. Affordances are useful as they support successful interactions and generally make navigation more intuitive. This can be done through things such as call-to-actions, buttons, links, input fields, icons, and UX copies. Although I knew about elements such as call to action and buttons before this, I never really paid any attention to them. But after understanding how helpful they can be, I've realized how important it is for me to ensure that I use affordances properly to ensure that users can use my website.

                During project support this week, I received valuable feedback on my wireframes. Specifically, I struggled to figure out how to lay out my community/discussions page effectively (this is why it has the most iterations). For my feedback,  they suggested that I space everything out a bit more to strike a balance between feeling empty and preventing overcrowding.  Initially, I also thought that adding a music function to the website would be fun because it could imitate a real-life café and make users feel as if they were actually in one. While it was creative, it was not necessary and could potentially confuse users. As a result, I decided to remove the music function to create a cleaner and less confusing user experience. Another key point that they reminded me of was to keep my icons consistent, as some of them had rounded edges while others did not. Overall, this feedback was really helpful and will be useful in helping me refine my final prototype as well as other future projects.
